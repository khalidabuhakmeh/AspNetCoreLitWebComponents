# Lit-Powered Web Components In ASP.NET Core

Razor is awesome and the power of server-rendered cannot be underestimated. That said, sometimes you want a pure client-side experience and that's where JavaScript comes in.

This solution shows how to set up Vite to build Lit components into standalone Web Components that can be reused through out your ASP.NET Core applications.

- Using the ViteMiddleware package that supports development time and build time. The caveat is your `package.json` has to be at the root, that's fine.
- The `Index.chstml` file has a `<my-counter></my-counter>` tag. **All Web Components must have a dash in them, it's the law of the internet.**
- The component is implemented under `Client/src/Counter.ts`.

```typescript
import {html, css, LitElement} from 'lit';
import {customElement, property} from 'lit/decorators.js';
@customElement("my-counter")
export class Counter extends LitElement {
    static get styles() {
        return css`
            button { font-size: 3em }
        `;
    }
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.count = 0;
        this.display = "Click Me";
    }
    @property()
    count = 0;
    @property()
    display = "Click Me";
    increment() {
        this.count++;
        this.display = `Current Count: ${this.count}`;
    }
    render() {
        return html`
            <button @click=${this.increment}>
                ${this.display}
            </button>
        `
    }
}
```
## Conclusion

This is an example, but here are some recommendations if you'd like to use this as a jumping off point:

1. Let Vite process all your assets, you can do neat things link minify, and purge unused files from the final artifacts build.
2. Remove all the `lib` from the project and add the dependencies from NPM, you get the benefits previously mentioned.
3. Read the VITE documentation, seriously.
4. Read the LIT documentation.
5. Get used to TypeScript. Most IDEs have great support for it, and you won't make as many mistakes.

## Conclusion

Hope you find this repository helpful. Cheers. üçª
